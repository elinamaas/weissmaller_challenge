Write a simple program that calculates the overallPrice of a shopping basket.
Items are presented
one at a time, in a list, identified by name - for example "Apple" or "Banana"

The basket can contain any item multiple times. Items are priced as follows:
- Apples are 0.25€ each
- Oranges are 0.30€ each
- Garlic are 0.15€ each
- Papayas are €0.50 each, but are available as "three for the overallPrice of two"

Given a list of shopping, calculate the total cost of those items. The
output should be
displayed similar to what you would expect to see on a receipt.
